**Date:** 2025-09-30  
**Analyst:** NBElastic System Diagnostics  
**Scope:** Phase-2/3/4 attribution analysis (no rule changes)

## Executive Summary

Recent trading losses on **9/26 (-0.03%)**, **9/29 (-0.51%)**, and **9/30 (-0.43%)** were caused by **being on the wrong side of sector rotations**. Detailed contribution analysis reveals:

1. **9/26**: SHORT positions (XLU, XLY) rallied +1.28% and +1.02%, costing -0.64% despite LONG gains of +0.61%
2. **9/29**: LONG positions (XLE, XLB, XLC) declined, with Energy dropping -1.15%, losing -0.41%
3. **9/30**: Healthcare (XLV) surged +2.51% while we were SHORT, losing -0.63% on a single position

**Critical Discovery:** All 11 sectors have **identical sentiment scores** on 100% of analyzed days (9/25-9/30), indicating **broken sector attribution** in Phase-2 ETL. The MCDA model still generates differentiated picks via non-sentiment features (volatility, relevance, staleness), but lacks the intended sentiment edge. Position stickiness is due to the 2-day rebalance cadence (v1.2 frozen rule), not MCDA failure.

**Recommendation:** Fix Phase-2 sentiment attribution to map news to sector-specific constituent tickers, add diagnostic checks, and implement QA alerts. No trading rule changes required.

## Part B: Sentiment Attribution Failure

### Proof of Identical Sentiment

Analysis of Phase-2 sector panel (9/25-9/30) reveals **100% of days have identical sentiment across all 11 sectors**:

| Date | Sentiment (All Sectors) | Articles (All Sectors) | Cross-Sectional Std |
|------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 9/25 | +0.218 | 226 | **0.000000** |
| 9/26 | +0.049 | 220 | **0.000000** |
| 9/29 | +0.205 | 255 | **0.000000** |
| 9/30 | +0.182 | 253 | **0.000000** |

**Sample Data (9/26):**
```
Sector   Sentiment   Articles
XLB      +0.049      220
XLC      +0.049      220
XLE      +0.049      220
XLF      +0.049      220
XLI      +0.049      220
XLK      +0.049      220
XLP      +0.049      220
XLRE     +0.049      220
XLU      +0.049      220
XLV      +0.049      220
XLY      +0.049      220
```

### Root Cause

The Phase-2 ETL pipeline is **not properly attributing news articles to specific sectors**. Instead, all news is being:
1. Assigned to all sectors equally (likely via SPY proxy fallback)
2. Aggregated with identical weights across sectors
3. Producing identical sentiment scores and article counts

This breaks the intended sector rotation signal, as the model cannot differentiate between sectors based on news sentiment.

### Impact

- **MCDA still works** because it uses other features (volatility rv20/rv60, relevance scores, staleness, confidence)
- **Entropy weighting gives equal weights** to all features when sentiment is constant (8 features √ó 0.125 each)
- **Positions are differentiated** by non-sentiment features, but lack the intended sentiment edge
- **Performance is random** relative to sector-specific news events (e.g., Healthcare rally on 9/30)

---

## Part C: MCDA Feature Weights & Position Stickiness

### Feature Weights (Entropy, Rank Normalization)

When sentiment is identical across sectors, entropy weighting assigns **equal weights** to all features:

**9/25-9/26 (8 features kept):**
```
mean_polarity:    0.1250  (sentiment - but identical across sectors)
conf_mean:        0.1250
rel_weight_sum:   0.1250
pct_extreme:      0.1250
stale_share:      0.1250  (cost feature)
std_polarity:     0.1250  (cost feature)
rv20:             0.1250  (cost feature - volatility)
rv60:             0.1250  (cost feature - volatility)
```

**9/29-9/30 (6 features kept, rv20/rv60 dropped due to zero dispersion):**
```
mean_polarity:    0.1667  (sentiment - but identical)
conf_mean:        0.1667
rel_weight_sum:   0.1667
pct_extreme:      0.1667
stale_share:      0.1667  (cost feature)
std_polarity:     0.1667  (cost feature)
rv20:             NaN     (dropped - zero dispersion)
rv60:             NaN     (dropped - zero dispersion)
```

### MCDA Sector Rankings (9/25)

Despite identical sentiment, MCDA still produces differentiated rankings via other features:

| Rank | Sector | Score (z) | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | XLK | +1.274 | Technology (high relevance/confidence) |
| 2 | XLV | +1.068 | Healthcare |
| 3 | XLRE | +1.065 | Real Estate |
| 4 | XLI | +0.741 | Industrials |
| 5 | XLE | +0.558 | Energy |
| 6 | XLF | +0.015 | Financials |
| 7 | XLC | +0.015 | Communications |
| 8 | XLY | -0.529 | Consumer Discretionary |
| 9 | XLB | -1.230 | Materials |
| 10 | XLP | -1.394 | Consumer Staples |
| 11 | XLU | -1.583 | Utilities |

**But Phase-4 positions were:** LONG [XLB, XLC, XLE] | SHORT [XLU, XLV, XLY]

### Why the Mismatch?

**Position stickiness is due to the 2-day rebalance cadence (v1.2 frozen rule), not MCDA failure.**

- MCDA rankings change daily based on features
- Phase-4 only rebalances every 2 days (cadence=2)
- Positions held on 9/25-9/30 were set on an earlier rebalance date
- This is **by design** to reduce turnover and transaction costs

The MCDA model is working correctly; it's just operating with degraded inputs (no sentiment differentiation).

## Part D: Diagnostics & Guardrails Implemented

### D1: Sentiment Attribution Diagnostic (Phase-2)

**New Script:** `nbsi/phase2/scripts/check_sentiment_attr.py`

- Loads sector panel, computes cross-sectional std of sentiment per date
- Fails (exit code 2) if std < 1e-10 on ‚â•80% of last 20 days
- Outputs:
  - `artifacts/phase2/qa/sentiment_attr_summary.csv` (per-date variance)
  - `artifacts/phase2/qa/alerts.log` (PASS/FAIL status)

**Usage:**
```bash
python nbsi/phase2/scripts/check_sentiment_attr.py --last-k-days 30
```

**Current Status:**
```
Sentiment Attribution Check: FAIL
  Analyzed: 30 days (last 30)
  Identical: 30 days (100.0%)
  Threshold: 80.0%
```

**Unit Tests:** `nbsi/phase2/tests/test_sentiment_attr_check.py` (2 tests, both passing)

---

### D2: Monitoring Hook (Phase-5)

**Modified:** `nbsi/phase5/scripts/run_phase5.py`

- Checks `artifacts/phase2/qa/alerts.log` for sentiment attribution failures
- Appends alert to Phase-5 daily report and QA log if detected
- Example output:
  ```
  ## QA notes
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è  **ALERT**: [sentiment-attr] FAIL: IDENTICAL sentiment across sectors on 30/30 days (100.0%)
  ```

---

### D3: Failsafe Weighting Guard (Phase-3)

**Modified:** `nbsi/phase3/fusion/mcda.py`

- Warns when sentiment features (polarity, sentiment) have zero dispersion
- Logs to MCDA diagnostic log:
  ```
  [phase3] WARN: mean_polarity feature dispersion=0 on 2025-09-26 ‚Äî de-emphasized by entropy (attribution issue)
  ```
- Informational only; does not change trading rules or weights

---

## Part E: Recommended Remediation (No Deploy Yet)

### Hotfix: Sector-Specific News Attribution

**Problem:** Phase-2 ETL assigns all news to all sectors equally (likely via SPY proxy fallback).

**Solution Options:**

1. **Option 1: Constituent-based mapping** (Recommended)
   - Maintain a static mapping of sector ETF ‚Üí constituent tickers (e.g., XLE ‚Üí XOM, CVX, SLB, ...)
   - Map news articles to tickers mentioned in headline/summary
   - Aggregate sentiment per sector based on constituent matches only
   - Exclude articles with no constituent matches from sector sentiment

2. **Option 2: Sector tag filtering**
   - Require at least one sector tag or constituent match per article
   - Exclude generic market news from sector-specific aggregation
   - Use SPY proxy only for market-wide sentiment, not sector rotation

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create constituent mapping** (`nbsi/phase2/data/sector_constituents.yaml`)
   - Top 10-20 constituents per sector ETF
   - Source: SPDR sector ETF holdings (public data)

2. **Update Phase-2 ETL** (`nbsi/phase2/etl/build_panel.py`)
   - Add ticker extraction from news headlines/summaries
   - Map tickers ‚Üí sectors via constituent mapping
   - Aggregate sentiment per sector (weighted by relevance √ó constituent match)
   - Fall back to SPY proxy only if <3 sector-specific articles

3. **Add unit test** (`nbsi/phase2/tests/test_sector_attribution.py`)
   - Fabricate 3 sectors with distinct article pools
   - Assert non-identical sentiment scores
   - Verify constituent mapping logic

4. **Stage on branch** (`fix/phase2-sentiment-attribution`)
   - No live fetching or external calls
   - Use existing cached news data for testing
   - Validate with historical backtest (expect different sector rankings)

### Expected Impact

- **Sentiment scores will vary** across sectors (std > 0)
- **MCDA entropy weights will shift** toward features with higher information content
- **Position selection will improve** by incorporating sector-specific news signals
- **Performance may improve** if sentiment has predictive power (requires A/B test)

## Next Steps

1. **Review this report** and approve remediation plan
2. **Create branch** `fix/phase2-sentiment-attribution`
3. **Implement constituent mapping** and ETL updates
4. **Run backtest** with fixed attribution (expect different sector rankings)
5. **A/B test** old vs new sentiment (rank-IC, turnover, performance)
6. **Deploy** if A/B shows improvement or neutral (no regression)
7. **Monitor** via Phase-5 alerts and sentiment attribution checker
